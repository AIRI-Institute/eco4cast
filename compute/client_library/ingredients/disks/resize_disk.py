    Resizes a persistent disk to a specified size in GB. After you resize the disk, you must
    also resize the file system so that the operating system can access the additional space.

    Args:
        project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project you want to use.
        disk_link: a link to the disk you want to resize.
            This value uses the following format:
                * https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project_name}/zones/{zone}/disks/{disk_name}
                * projects/{project_name}/zones/{zone}/disks/{disk_name}
                * projects/{project_name}/regions/{region}/disks/{disk_name}
        new_size_gb: the new size you want to set for the disk in gigabytes.
