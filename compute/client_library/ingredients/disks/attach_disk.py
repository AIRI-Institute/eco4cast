    """
    Attaches a non-boot persistent disk to a specified compute instance. The disk might be zonal or regional.

    You need following permissions to execute this action:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/regional-persistent-disk#expandable-1

    Args:
        project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project you want to use.
        zone:name of the zone in which the instance you want to use resides.
        instance_name: name of the compute instance you want to attach a disk to.
        disk_link: full or partial URL to a persistent disk that you want to attach. This can be either
            regional or zonal disk.
            Expected formats:
                * https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[project]/zones/[zone]/disks/[disk_name]
                * /projects/[project]/zones/[zone]/disks/[disk_name]
                * /projects/[project]/regions/[region]/disks/[disk_name]
        mode: Specifies in what mode the disk will be attached to the instance. Available options are `READ_ONLY`
            and `READ_WRITE`. Disk in `READ_ONLY` mode can be attached to multiple instances at once.
